You can\u2019t really trust anyone else or yourself either. You\u2019re scared that the people you care about might actually be there to hurt you and you\u2019re even more scared of strangers. You haven\u2019t left the house in over a week now except for this trip to the GP. Even then it took three attempts to work up the courage to leave the house. You don\u2019t trust yourself to be normal outside since you\u2019ve been getting worse and worse mood swings. Your best friend mentioned getting worried and you just shouted at her. You\u2019re also exhausted since you\u2019re getting no sleep at all, you feel like you can\u2019t relax since you don\u2019t feel safe. When you finally manage to fall asleep you get the worst nightmares. You\u2019ve since added a second lock to the door.\nYou have been getting flashbacks to your ex-husband. He was a mean and violent drunk. You do wonder if there was anything you could\u2019ve done or any way you could\u2019ve been better so that he wouldn\u2019t have hurt you. Sometimes you day dream about getting revenge but you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to.\nYou\u2019ve not had any suicidal thoughts. You\u2019re feeling more and more detached from people.

A fine line indeed!\nAppropriate differential diagnoses are PTSD, Depression with Agoraphobia, Complicated grief reaction, and Enduring personality change after trauma. These can be added to a degree of alcohol dependence as well.\nManagement plan should include continuing a strong doctor-patient relationship (since this can only be treated if the relationship is built on mutual trust), trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy, Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), stress management information, relaxation therapies and addressing the alcohol dependence. Drug treatment is second line and it is less useful for it to be mentioned at this point.\nExample questions and answers:\nWhat are risk factors for PTSD? Exposure to trauma or combat, refugee/asylum seeker status, first responder occupation, combat specific (duration of exposure, low morale, poor social support, lower rank, unmarried, low educational attainment, childhood adversity), previous psychiatric disorders.\nIs PTSD the same for everyone? No it is not. Some people may develop some form of it following an event which self-resolves in 6 months. Others will only develop one of the three key symptoms (Hypervigilance, flashbacks and rumination). There is also a cultural\naspect to it which might lead to people presenting with medically unexplained symptoms rather than a direct psychological complaint.\nWhich neurotransmitter is involved in the fight or flight response?

You have been working long hours, and might have skipped a lunch or two, but haven\u2019t been trying to lose weight or anything.

He always did take notice of you than your ex-husband did. Your husband always saw you, but he never really saw you. Anyway.\nThe lesion started off as a bit of a big mole. It was a bit of a funny shape, and grew slowly and gradually. It was funny at the time: the more you looked at it, the more you convinced yourself it actually looked like a mole \u2013 as in the small woodland mammal.\nThe mole didn\u2019t just get bigger, it seemed to change colour as well. It went from being a pale brown colour \u2013 like a nice mahogany table \u2013 to the colour of coal. You thought at the time that this was just down to your recent tan.\nThe mole did bleed from time to time \u2013 but it was at the point of your bra strap and you feel that you were occasionally nicking it by accident. It occasionally was itchy and flakey too.\nYou have had lots of moles in the past \u2013 seems like you\u2019ve got hundreds of them! However, they\u2019ve never given you any bother in the past, so you\u2019re not sure why this one would be any different at all. You haven\u2019t got any rashes anywhere else on your body.

You\u2019ve never had the patience, and find those weight loss programmes ghastly.\nPMH:\nYou have always been relatively well. You had a bad case of flu last summer \u2013 you\u2019re convinced it was swine flu. It brought you into hospital and you had to go into an isolation room.

You take cod liver oil and vitamin C tablets, and they keep you just right!\nICE: \nYou began to become worried about this mole when it started to get so noticeable that your ex-husband picked up on it. It must have been huge if he saw it! That was a couple of months ago \u2013 you then decided that you would fly back to the UK to get it seen to. You don\u2019t trust the local doctors in Gran Canaria.\nYou were hoping that it would just be a simple mole and nothing too bothersome \u2013 you are very moley after all! Unfortunately, the doctors told you that they thought it was a type of skin cancer. That has scared you, and you have stuck around in your UK home since then. You feel so bad about all the sunbathing you have done in the last few years\u2026 but what else were you supposed to do with all that lottery money! You earned that time to yourself, to do whatever you liked!\nSH:\nYou live in a lovely villa in Gran Canaria. You don\u2019t do any work any more \u2013 you spend most of your time sunbathing outside on the lawn, or sometimes by the pool. You grew up in the UK and occasionally used sunbeds \u2013 you\u2019ve always hated how pale you were. You like to feel very tan, because then all your freckles and moles don\u2019t stand out as much.\nYou were married to your husband, Nigel, however you feel that he has been living off your winnings for far too long, and has become so ungrateful. Since you got the news about the cancer, you told him to pack his bags and leave \u2013 life is far too short for people like that! \nYou\u2019re not very active, but do occasionally go swimming.\nFH:\nYour mum died of bowel cancer when you were very young, and your dad left when you were young so you didn\u2019t know him.\n", "ein": "The student should take a focused history of this lesion, focusing on risk factors for malignant melanoma of the skin.

The pain occurs in your lower tummy but you can\u2019t pinpoint a particular area that is worse. It is a severe cramping pain that comes in waves. It sometimes goes to your back and to the tops of your legs.

You have also felt sore and achey all over and much more tired than usual.\nTwo days ago, you developed a cough which was dry at first but then began bringing up phlegm which was clear to begin with but has started turning green.

Going back and forward to the toilet has been unbearable, as you haven\u2019t been able to do anything else at all.\nThe bowel motions themselves have been a yellow/brown colour and you have not noticed any blood or mucus-y stuff.

You don\u2019t know what happened, but you could not get back up off the floor. \nYou had no headache, no aura, no dizziness, no palpitation, and no strange feelings. You remember falling to the floor and just felt a bit helpless as there was nothing you could do to stop yourself. You hit your head when you fell, you couldn\u2019t manage to put your arm out to stop your fall.\nYou did not lose consciousness, and did not feel unwell, just weak. You had no incontinence or tongue biting. \nYour left leg and arm remain weak and you still cannot walk, or pick anything up. However, you can lift your arm up a little if asked to. Any force downwards causes it to go down again. It is the same with your left leg. \nYour vision was previously manageable, you just got some trendy new glasses as you are a little short sighted! However, since lunchtime you keep getting a shock when people come towards you from the side, you don\u2019t understand why.\nAfter the fall your wife had to help prop you up against a cupboard, where you stayed until your son (\u2018he\u2019s just a lovely young man don\u2019t you know, doing really well, working as a lawyer!

When you finally manage to fall asleep you get the worst nightmares. You\u2019ve since added a second lock to the door.\nYou have been getting flashbacks to your ex-husband. He was a mean and violent drunk. You do wonder if there was anything you could\u2019ve done or any way you could\u2019ve been better so that he wouldn\u2019t have hurt you. Sometimes you day dream about getting revenge but you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to.\nYou\u2019ve not had any suicidal thoughts. You\u2019re feeling more and more detached from people.

A fine line indeed!\nAppropriate differential diagnoses are PTSD, Depression with Agoraphobia, Complicated grief reaction, and Enduring personality change after trauma. These can be added to a degree of alcohol dependence as well.\nManagement plan should include continuing a strong doctor-patient relationship (since this can only be treated if the relationship is built on mutual trust), trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy, Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), stress management information, relaxation therapies and addressing the alcohol dependence. Drug treatment is second line and it is less useful for it to be mentioned at this point.\nExample questions and answers:\nWhat are risk factors for PTSD? Exposure to trauma or combat, refugee/asylum seeker status, first responder occupation, combat specific (duration of exposure, low morale, poor social support, lower rank, unmarried, low educational attainment, childhood adversity), previous psychiatric disorders.\nIs PTSD the same for everyone? No it is not. Some people may develop some form of it following an event which self-resolves in 6 months. Others will only develop one of the three key symptoms (Hypervigilance, flashbacks and rumination). There is also a cultural\naspect to it which might lead to people presenting with medically unexplained symptoms rather than a direct psychological complaint.\nWhich neurotransmitter is involved in the fight or flight response?

It\u2019s not cheering her up or making her feel better. \nShe\u2019s got stabilisers on her bike still You\u2019ve not been able to teach her how to ride as you\u2019ve been a single mum for years and have to work a lot, but your new boyfriend Jason said he\u2019ll take her out and teach her. He\u2019s been great at watching the kids while you\u2019re at work, especially since it\u2019s been half term. \nThe fall happened while you were at work, so you didn\u2019t see it. Jason told you about it when you got home, he says she was showing off on her bike and was going too fast and hit the curb. He says she was fine at the time, but things must have gotten worse as the day went on, because now she\u2019s really quiet and obviously in pain. That\u2019s why you brought her in, Jason was going out tonight so he couldn\u2019t come with you. \nYou haven\u2019t noticed any other injuries, other than the usual knocks and bruises you\u2019d expect for a kid her age. She\u2019s a handful and that\u2019s all part of being a kid and growing up. You think she\u2019s maybe had a few more bruises recently, since the baby and then Jason moving in, but Jason thinks she\u2019s just been playing a bit rougher and \u201cshowing off\u201d to get attention because she\u2019s jealous of the new baby. You\u2019ve not had a good look at her recently, Jason is often the one to bath Meghan and put her to bed if you\u2019re busy with Harry or working shifts. It\u2019s often after bedtime when you get home. \nPMH: Meghan was born at term by normal delivery with no complications, and she\u2019s fully vaccinated. She was bottle fed, and is usually a good eater now but has been a bit more picky with food and not eating as well recently. You feel this is probably because of all the changes in the house. \nShe has eczema and very mild hayfever, but doesn\u2019t need any medications. You put cream on her skin before bed but her eczema is usually well controlled. She has no allergies. \nDevelopment: She hit all of her milestones and is a very bright little girl. She\u2019s very playful and has lots of friends at school. She loves going to school and is doing very well in Year 1.\nFH: Her dad had asthma in childhood you think, but it was never a problem for him as an adult. There\u2019s nothing else that runs in the family and, other than being exhausted, your well in yourself. \nSH: At home there is you, Meghan, Harry and Jason. Jason isn\u2019t dad to either Meghan or Harry, but you\u2019ve known him for a while. You started a relationship about 3 months ago and he wanted to move in and help with the kids, since their dad isn\u2019t really involved much. He moved in about a month ago and you feel very luck that someone would want to take on both you and the kids \nYou wanted to take more time off work when you had Harry, as he\u2019s only a month old, but you work in a care home and they\u2019re short staffed and you need the money so you had to go back to work. Jason doesn\u2019t work at the moment, so it\u2019s easier and cheaper for him to watch the kids than paying for childcare, and you don\u2019t have any relatives close by who could help. \nNobody smokes in the house. Jason usually has a couple of cans of lager every night, but you don\u2019t drink. \nJason has never been aggressive towards you, and you\u2019ve never been concerned about him or his behaviour. You\u2019re not aware of any previous violence or run-ins with the police but it\u2019s never come up so you\u2019ve never asked!\nICE: You weren\u2019t worried, sometimes children go through phases especially when there\u2019s been a big change so the new baby and Jason moving in probably explains the rough play and change in Meghan\u2019s behaviour recently. \nYou trust Jason and don\u2019t think this has anything to do with him. You\u2019re hurt and offended that anyone would dare suggest that you or him might have hurt your daughter. You\u2019re glad he\u2019s not with you to hear this, because he\u2019d be furious and it\u2019d probably drive a wedge between you if something like this happened. \nYou don\u2019t want social workers getting involved because you think they\u2019ll take your kids away from you. You work all the hours you can to be a good mother and how dare anyone say you\u2019re not and threaten to take your kids away. \nYou just want to go home, it\u2019s already late and you had to bring Harry with you, and it\u2019s way past both of their bedtimes. It\u2019s hard enough getting them into a routine as it is and this is going to disrupt everything, especially since you\u2019re at work early tomorrow and Jason is out tonight.\n", "ein": "The student should focus on what, why, when, how, witnesses, and social aspects of history with a non-judgemental approach. \nThe student needs to be open and honest with mum at all times.

You asked her but she can\u2019t remember falling over or bumping it, and you checked with the teachers the next morning who don\u2019t report anything having happened at school.\nToday when you got Hallie up for school, you noticed her hopping down the stairs on her right leg for breakfast. When you asked her to walk properly, she said that she couldn\u2019t because it hurt to put her left foot down. When she tried to show you, she started crying saying it was too painful and immediately sat down and refused to get back up. You\u2019ve had to carry her everywhere since then.\nPoor Hallie has been through the works the last few weeks- she missed 3 days of school last week due to having a dreadful bug that gave her a bit of a fever, a runny nose and a cough. These symptoms have disappeared, but you did notice her feeling a little warm this morning when you picked her up, although you haven\u2019t measured her temperature.\nOther than her painful left leg, Hallie has returned to her normal bright self.

You know Hallie loves dancing, and are concerned that she\u2019ll have to miss her dance show in three weeks, that she\u2019s worked really, really hard for.\nDevelopmental History:\nHallie was born at 40 weeks. She was a breech baby, but was still able to be delivered vaginally. A day after she was born, the doctor came to check Hallie over, and it was found that her right hip was clicky. She had to be in a strange splint thing for about 6 weeks, and after that she didn\u2019t have any more problems, and she started walking at 1 year.\nShe\u2019s always been quite on target with all her other milestones. You have no worries about social or physical development. She\u2019s always eaten well, and has never been too small or too big. She\u2019s a bright girl, always getting 10/10 on her spellings.

Neither of you smoke nor do you let anybody smoke in your home. Both children attend the same local primary school, a five-minute walk from your house.

An examination of the hip would be appropriate, but a pGALS examination could also be performed.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMy differential diagnosis would include causes of hip pain and limp in a child. Hallie\u2019s symptoms would fit with a diagnosis of transient synovitis. She is clinically well, with a mild pyrexia, and is recovering from an upper respiratory tract infection. It is important to rule out septic arthritis, due to the destructive nature of this condition, but children tend to be systemically unwell. Other causes of hip pain in a six year old would include Legg-Calve-Perthe\u2019s disease, in which there is avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and juvenile arthritis. These conditions would be expected to have a more gradual onset, over weeks rather than days. Hallie also has a history of developmental dysplasia of the hip, which could cause a limp in a child. However this limp would more likely be painless, have been more longstanding, and from the history, it sounds like this condition was treated early.\nDiscussion Questions:\nWhat is transient synovitis?\nWhat would be appropriate investigations to carry out in Hallie? What results would you expect?\nHow is transient synovitis managed? How does this compare to management of septic arthritis? \nWhat would be appropriate advice to give Hallie\u2019s father?\nHallie was born with DDH.

You experienced about two months of bloody diarrhoea that became more and more frequent, and lost about a stone and a half in weight. You also got really painful ulcers in your mouth. This was quite embarrassing for you as a university student and it took you a little while to present. In fact, you didn\u2019t go and see anybody about it until a particularly bad week when you experienced horrific abdominal pains, and very frequent bloody diarrhoea- up to 8 motions a day.

You then had to have a colonoscopy where they took parts of the tissue of your colon to look at under a microscope, which was so embarrassing for you.\nAfter your hospital admission you were started on some medications, that you were told would help you recover from this bad episode. There was a steroid medication, and another one called mesalazine.\nYou then had to keep seeing doctors after that. They told you that you had something called \u201cCrohn\u2019s Disease\u201d and that it was a condition where your digestive tract became inflamed, which is what had caused the bleeding and the ulcers. You were told that with medication it could be controlled, but that sometimes it may flare up similar to your recent hospital admission. Your doctor started you on this medication, Azathioprine, that you had to take every day.\nYou had a relapse of disease about six months after diagnosis.

This episode was similar to the first episode you had, with extreme pain, and never ending bloody diarrhoea. You were started on the steroid tablets and mesalazine again and recovered, but your consultant warned you that acting as you had could allow your disease to get out of control, and that you could end up with a stoma bag if it got too bad.
