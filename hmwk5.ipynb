You’ve had epilepsy for over 20 years now and have been seizure free for 13 years. Unfortunately, last year you had a ‘fit’ when you went to the restaurant for your birthday. Your partner witnessed the events. You were started on lamotrigine.

      " You have come to clinic due to worsening breathlessness over the last 2 months. The first thing you noticed was that you were struggling when walking down the street to the pub, and doing big shops on a Saturday in the square. It has been getting harder over this period where you had to stop and rest during shopping, now your wife does it for you. You can still get around your house but struggle to walk far without getting breathless.\n",
      "You have found that when you get breathless, you begin to cough and often bring up pink foamy stuff during particularly bad coughing fits. This happens while lying flat in bed, so you have recently started using three pillows to sleep. You thought about getting one of those fancy mattresses that massages your back and lifts you off the bed, but you’d be worried that it’d be so soft you’d never want to get out of bed!\n",
      "Yesterday you fainted while cleaning the house. You felt dizzy all of a sudden and felt you needed to sit down, but fell and lost consciousness briefly before you could get to the sofa. No one saw this. You came round quickly but felt ‘rough’ and fatigued afterwards.  You don’t think you hit your head, and didn’t bite your tongue. You don’t remember hitting the floor. Your wife found you on the sofa while you were recovering and you felt quite embarrassed about it. You hate showing any weakness.\n",
      "You have had a couple of episodes in the past week where you have woken suddenly during the night feeling like you are unable to breathe.

He’s a good lad. You had been feeling increasingly dizzy, and this has been getting worse since your problems with breathlessness.\n",

You live with your wife, Polly, who works as a secretary at a local law firm. She has had to do more around the house recently as well as the shopping. You feel bad, because she does so much already. You realise that you are really lucky to have her in your life. You have two boys who have recently moved out. You smoke 20 a day and have since you were 18. You used to drink several pints on weekends with your friends, but struggle to get out as much now.\n",
      "ICE – You think it has something to do with your bad heart. Your wife has had to do more and more of your daily activities and you are concerned that if you don’t get better she will have to give up her job to take care of you full time and that you are increasingly becoming a burden on her. You expect to get medication that will help you get around better.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Cardiovascular examination would be appropriate in this case, however a Respiratory exam to could also be justified to rule out other causes of breathlessness.\n",
      "A reasonable differential diagnosis would sound something like:\n",
      "“My main differential diagnosis would be a cardiovascular cause: more specifically Heart Failure. This is due to the progressively worsening dyspnoea, frothy pink sputum, postural nocturnal dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance on the background of multiple cardiac risk factors, such as hypertension and smoking.\n",
      "An alternative diagnosis would be a respiratory cause: namely COPD. This could be argued as a differential due to the sputum, chronic breathlessness and smoking history.”\n",

You stopped for a coffee break at 10:30, but when you got up to walk into the kitchen, you walked into the right hand side of the doorway, which is strange, because you didn’t feel dizzy or anything, and normally your vision is perfect with contact lenses. When trying to make your coffee, you dropped your mug on the floor and found you couldn’t grip things properly with your right hand. Your leg felt a bit numb as well, but put both symptoms down to a trapped nerve. A patient arrived at the desk to sign in at 10:45, but you realised you were struggling to get your words out. You started to feel anxious, but when you got up to find your colleague in the office, your right leg felt weak and collapsed underneath you. \n",

      "HPC: \n",
      "Earlier today Kai was playing in your room and grabbed the plastic cable for the hair straighteners which you had recently used. They fell onto him and he had burnt his skin before you managed to get to him. You were in the next room and heard his cries. You wrapped his leg in cling film, gave him some calpol and brought him to hospital. You got a lift here from your boyfriend.\n",

      "Your pregnancy with Kai was uncomplicated- you gave birth by caesarean section at 37 weeks because you had a C-section with his older sister Nina due to failure to progress. He was a healthy baby. He eats 3 meals a day with his sister and snacks if he’s hungry between. He is mostly toilet trained but continues to have some accidents and has done so whilst at A&E.\n",
      "He is a very outgoing child and can name objects and say a few names. He’s been to hospital a couple of times before for other bumps and scrapes. You did say he was clumsy! Otherwise, he is fit and well if a little on the small side. Ky and Nina both had chicken pox last year.\n",
      "He is up to date on vaccinations and takes no other medication, has no allergies you know of.\n",
      "Your mother and sister have both had ovarian cancer but nothing else runs in the family. At home, its just the three of you, and your boyfriend sometimes comes over. You are unemployed and the kids’ father is no longer around, so things are financially stressful. Kai doesn’t really see his dad any more.\n",
      "You see your family occasionally but are not close. You smoke, but only in the garden. There has been no social services involvement with your family, though it was offered as Kai’s dad could be violent at times. Kai doesn’t go to nursery or playgroup and you mostly both stay in the house while Nina is at school.\n",

      "One week ago you noticed that Eimear suddenly felt very hot. You have a thermometer at home and took a temperature, which was 39.4˚C. Her temperature has been up and down over the past few days and has been really high. You gave her some paracetamol to try and bring the temperature down, but it didn’t seem to have much effect.

Then the skin around her hands and feet also went red and swollen before starting to peel. She also has redness around her bottom and she keeps scratching it. This isn’t new – she used to get bad nappy rash when she was younger – though it did look slightly different than this.\n",
      "It was all really distressing and you didn’t know what to do, so you brought her into hospital. Since you have been in the waiting room she has started rubbing at her eyes a lot and they also look red. You have also noticed some small, hard lumps on the left side of her neck.\n",
      "She hasn’t had any cough, headache, diarrhoea or vomiting. Because she has been so grizzly she has been eating and drinking less than normal. Today she hasn’t eaten or drank anything because her mouth is so sore. She last went for a wee about 6 hours ago.\n",

      "A lot of this case is going to come from body language and non-verbal communication so this is going to have both your ICE but also some behaviour cues to help. Speak quietly and in perfunctory sentences. Avoid eye contact, either looking at the ground or focussing on your hands. Give limited information making it obvious you’re holding something back.

      "Initially you just say that you think you’ve just started to drink excessively as a habit- you actually think you’re drinking to cope and try and drown out the thoughts. You’re worried that this will continue and that eventually you’ll spiral down so far you’ll become a recluse or kill yourself. You are scared of how much control your ex-husband still has in your life even after you had thought you’d managed to escape his grasp. You don’t expect anything from this, you’re pretty sure you’re too far gone for help at this point but its worth a shot.\n",
      "History of Presenting Complaint\n",
      "You have come to the GP because you’re drinking too much alcohol and its getting in the way of your ability to think. You drink a bottle of wine over the course of three days, white wine approximately 11%. You do not take break days and instead find yourself drinking every day. You don’t really get angry when other people question your drinking since you don’t really have anybody else to notice it.\n",
      "You’ve been isolating yourself more and more. You can’t really trust anyone else or yourself either. You’re scared that the people you care about might actually be there to hurt you and you’re even more scared of strangers. You haven’t left the house in over a week now except for this trip to the GP. Even then it took three attempts to work up the courage to leave the house. You don’t trust yourself to be normal outside since you’ve been getting worse and worse mood swings. Your best friend mentioned getting worried and you just shouted at her. You’re also exhausted since you’re getting no sleep at all, you feel like you can’t relax since you don’t feel safe. When you finally manage to fall asleep you get the worst nightmares. You’ve since added a second lock to the door.\n",
      "You have been getting flashbacks to your ex-husband. He was a mean and violent drunk. You do wonder if there was anything you could’ve done or any way you could’ve been better so that he wouldn’t have hurt you. Sometimes you day dream about getting revenge but you don’t think you’ll be able to.\n",
      "You’ve not had any suicidal thoughts. You’re feeling more and more detached from people. In fact, you’ve given up all your hobbies and barely talk to anyone now. You struggle to concentrate at times. You have not had any hallucinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very difficult case for the student. Here the focus is on communication skills and ability to build a rapport with the patient. If they take a superficial history exclusively on alcohol despite the hints dropped by the patient then they have missed the point of the exercise. Additionally, if they probe too hard on this initial meeting they risk damaging the doctor patient relationship. A fine line indeed!\n",
      "Appropriate differential diagnoses are PTSD, Depression with Agoraphobia, Complicated grief reaction, and Enduring personality change after trauma. These can be added to a degree of alcohol dependence as well.\n",
      "Management plan should include continuing a strong doctor-patient relationship (since this can only be treated if the relationship is built on mutual trust), trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy, Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), stress management information, relaxation therapies and addressing the alcohol dependence. Drug treatment is second line and it is less useful for it to be mentioned at this point.\n",
      "Example questions and answers:\n",
      "What are risk factors for PTSD? Exposure to trauma or combat, refugee/asylum seeker status, first responder occupation, combat specific (duration of exposure, low morale, poor social support, lower rank, unmarried, low educational attainment, childhood adversity), previous psychiatric disorders.\n",
      "Is PTSD the same for everyone? No it is not. Some people may develop some form of it following an event which self-resolves in 6 months. Others will only develop one of the three key symptoms (Hypervigilance, flashbacks and rumination). There is also a cultural\n",
      "aspect to it which might lead to people presenting with medically unexplained symptoms rather than a direct psychological complaint.\n",
      "Which neurotransmitter is involved in the fight or flight response? Adrenaline.\n",

      "\n",
      "You are Sarah Bellum, a lady who enjoys swimming and hill-walking. Unfortunately, you are unable to do many of your favourite activities anymore because of a diagnosis which has turned your life upside down: motor neuron disease.\n",
      "HPC:\n",
      "You first noticed something was wrong around 8 months ago. You used to play tennis with a few friends at the local tennis club, and you found your performance dropping. Whilst you originally put this down to older age – your reflexes aren’t what they used to be – you became concerned when you were dropping the balls that you went to pick up. When this continued into your home life, for example struggling with the front door key and opening plastic bottles, you went to seek help.\n",
      "After your diagnosis, you noticed that your legs became increasingly heavy, and you found it quite challenging to get up your stairs and to get out of your seat. It’s like your legs are made of lead sometimes. You were determined to keep up with your walking, but you found yourself tripping up more and more frequently. On one occasion you fell and hit your head on the pavement and gave yourself a frightful black eye – that was the last straw. You haven’t been out walking since.\n",
      "The emotional trauma of managing this diagnosis has been terrible. You try to stay strong for your husband and your (now grown up) children, but you know the realities of this condition. You are tired all the time now, and feel extremely dependent on others to get around in your wheelchair. You’re not sure if this is now because of the heaviness and weakness in your legs, or because of your loss of confidence.\n",
      "You haven’t had any numbness or change in sensation in your arms or legs. You haven’t passed out, or had any fits or funny turns. Your breathing is absolutely fine, but you’re scared that you’re going to have problems with this in the future.\n",
      "You map how your condition has progressed by your diary entries. You have always kept a private journal so that you can organise your thoughts – over time you can see your handwriting become worse and worse, as your hands became stiffer and you developed cramps when writing even short pieces of text. You always had lovely handwriting. You don’t write in the journal any more – instead you try to type your thoughts out on the tablet that your husband got you, but it’s not the same.\n",

You do not expect to live much longer than a year or two, and you’re not sure that you would want to live that long, either. You’ve met people at the end of their life with motor neurone disease, and you find it incredibly depressing. You don’t want to be trapped inside your own body. Occasionally you remember your long walks in the hills with your husband – it’s how you met – and you become emotional with fondness and bitterness.\n",
      "You’re worried about how your family are going to cope with your illness over the coming few months. You’ve always looked after everyone, and taken pride in it. You’re fiercely proud of your independence, and the idea of being cared for, twenty-four hours a day, terrifies you.

You must ask your GP about this next time you’re in.\n",
      "SH:\n",
      "You live in a lovely old house that your family have owned for generations. You would find it abhorrent to move out of this house: it would be the very definition of giving up. However, you haven’t been upstairs for a long time now, as it depresses you having to use that stairlift.\n",
      "You have an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist and some carers who come in from time to time to check on you.

Saying that, your husband keeps saying that you’re losing weight and looking thin.\n",

An excellent candidate will explore Sarah’s attitudes to the progression of her illness and allow her to reflect on what the future may hold for her in terms of care. In terms of examination, an upper or lower limb motor neurological exam would be appropriate.\n",

You didn’t notice at first but this morning you definitely think your eyes and face look a bit yellowy.\n",

You are currently hearing the voices telling you to lie to the medical student: to confabulate and make up ridiculous information to hide your story. You want to tell the truth, but you can’t help but mention random, irrelevant and impossible information.\n",

      "There are about five different voices who speak to you. They are men and women and one of them is a little girl. You do not recognise the voices as belonging to anyone that you know, although one of them has a thick Glaswegian accent. They talk about you in the third person and say things like “he’s a loser” and “he doesn’t have a clue what he’s doing”. Sometimes they just commentate on what you are doing, for example “now he’s putting the milk in his tea, what an idiot, he hasn’t brewed it for long enough.” You know the voices might not be real but they feel so real that you cannot help but listen. The voices seem to come from outside your head.\n",

      "My differential diagnosis would include a pharmaceutical cause: specifically, paracetamol overdose. It does not obviously appear to have caused hepatic failure from the end of the bed, however I would need to investigate further for this using the appropriate criteria.

You were admitted to hospital that they found out what was really going on: you have cysts on your kidney. Since your first admission where they did lots of tests, things have been slowly been deteriorating but that’s fine as you are glad you don’t have cancer.\n",
      "Since then you’ve had been to hospital over six times because of kidney stones. However, your last admission a few months ago was the scariest one yet. You had a “subarachnoid haemorrhage”. You were in the pub with your mates and then suddenly you thought someone had taken a baseball bat and hit the back of your head. You felt sick and your mates got you to hospital immediately. Luckily, it was only a small bleed and you’ve been fine since then. You have occasional tingling in your fingers, but luckily nothing else. A small price to pay!\n",

The patient also describes a history and family history of subarachnoid haemorrhage, which is a known complication of polycystic kidney disease.

He had told the receptionist over the phone that her mood had been “the worse it’s been” and that she needs to talk to someone. You see from her GP electronic notes she has been consulted once in the past year for ‘low mood’ but with very little other information provided. She has no repeat medications. The last time she presented to the GP practice was 3 years old for an urinary tract infection. There is little else in her past medical history.\n",

      "HPC – since the death of your mother  one year ago and the building extra pressure from work deadlines in the last few months, you have noticed feeling more hopeless and guilty about not enjoying spending time with your family, or anyone else for that matter. You find yourself waking up a couple of hours before your alarm every morning, and nevertheless feeling exhausted throughout the whole day. Even making a phone-call seems like a massive effort. Your boss has noticed your work effort has slowed, and work colleagues have made concerned comments about your attention span and concentration during conversations. You find meeting discussions more and more difficult to remember and have very little motivation to do well at work. You have even had periods in the day when you feel completely out of it – as if you were watching yourself on a TV screen as the rest of life carries on around you. It is very hard to talk or relate to people, and you often would rather be left alone.\n",
      "Your mother died of a stroke, and you miss her a lot and think of her often. You often feel guilty for not contacting her more often in her later years, especially as she had been there for you a lot in your childhood. Your father, who you have no contact with now, physically abused you and your mother when you were a schoolchild, causing your mother to soon run away with you and start a new life. You do not remember a lot about that time. You remember being occasionally bullied at your secondary school as your mother could not afford the latest clothes and school-kit for you, but otherwise you remember the remainder of your childhood without unease.\n",
      "Today is the year anniversary of your mother’s death, and you have felt particularly low. Last night you couldn’t sleep at all, and swore you heard your mother’s voice calling out for you in the night. Paul awoke when you called back for her and started crying, but couldn’t console you. You have not seen or heard anything else that Paul couldn’t. Later, as Paul slept, you thought about how life might be easier for your family if you weren’t there, and thought about ways you could end your life. You have never had these thoughts before. You had made no formal plans about how and when you would do it, but crept downstairs to write a potential suicide note which Paul found early the following morning. You would never want to harm anyone else, and have never self-harmed yourself.\n",
      "ICE – your main fear is that your mood will bring your family down, and you worry one day Thomas will become depressed like you too. You feel it might be better if you weren’t there at all, and then they could get on with a normal life. You were willing to come to the GPs today, as long as Paul wasn’t there too, as you thought he would just get upset listening to you speak. You would consider getting help and taking medication, if it solved everything and made your mood completely better. Can the tablets do that?\n",
      "PMH – normally your mood is not an issue, although you did suffer from ‘baby blues’ after having Thomas. You take no regular medications and have had no psychiatric service input before.\n",
      "SH - You love Paul, and both love your son very much. For the past eight months it has not been a sexual relationship with Paul, as you have no energy. Paul has been keen to try for another child, but you feel your energy levels would not sustain a pregnancy, let alone bringing up another child. Paul often works from home and looks after Thomas most days, with his parents living round the corner for extra support when needed.\n",
      "Paul comments you are eating less and you admit your clothes have felt looser over the course of the year. If Paul or Thomas aren’t around you, you sometimes forget to eat. You used to enjoy gardening and cake-decorating, but have avoided doing either for the past year. You have never smoked and drink very rarely.\n",
      "FH – your mother had depression and your father had schizophrenia\n",
      "\n",
      "The student should spend fifteen minutes exploring the biological and non-biological symptoms of depression, as well as exploring psychotic symptoms and a risk assessment. The mental state examination should cover the patient’s appearance, behaviour, speech, mood (both subjectively and objectively), perception, cognition and insight.\n",
      "The student’s MSE may sound like this: Anita looks tired but well-dressed, with poor eye contact and a quiet monotonous speech. Her speech is reactive but slow. She feels her mood is low, which I agree with, and has experienced one auditory hallucination of her dead mother calling her name. She feels her attention, concentration and memory have been poorer in the past year. She has admitted to suicidal ideation – although she has no set plans on when or how, she has already written a suicide note. She has some insight as she is aware her mood is an issue and would be willing to take part in treatment, although she still feels her family may be happier without her.\n",

It started off simply covering your big toe, but has since spread up to the middle of your calf. It is now really painful and you cannot put any weight on it at all. You also feel generally unwell and your daughter noticed that you felt very warm to the touch. You haven’t actually taken your temperature, though – you’re afraid of what you will find!\n",

If anything it’s been getting worse and you’ve been taking paracetamol regularly most days but it’s not really helping much. In the last couple of weeks you’ve found it difficult to move your leg at all because of the pain and you’re struggling to walk.

Then you tried to have a lie down on the sofa, and that didn’t work either. That’s when you started to get concerned. You developed a bad cough over the following few hours, and when you coughed up a little bit of blood, that was the last straw: you went straight to A&E.\n",
      "In terms of the cough, there wasn’t any green or white stuff, just mostly dry with occasional spotting of blood. The side of your chest was a little sore, mostly when you tried to take a deep breath in. It was a sharp pain, which didn’t really move anywhere. Nothing made it better, and you felt that it was stopping you from breathing properly. You didn’t have a temperature at this time.\n",
      "The main reason for your worries was because you’re currently undergoing chemotherapy for Multiple Myeloma. You have been in and out of hospital receiving the treatment – this is your second cycle. The first cycle was an absolute disaster: you ended up having to go into hospital with a really bad chest infection. They told you that the chemotherapy had messed with your immune system, and that made you at risk of picking up a bug. At that time you had a bad temperature and green phlegm in your cough. This time it felt different, however.\n",
      "You have lost quite a bit of weight recently, but that is apparently to be expected with the Myeloma. You had some diarrhea, but again this was something you were warned about when you had the chemotherapy.\n",
      "Once you got into hospital, they did a scan and told you that you had a blood clot in your lung. They put you on some medicine to thin your blood and got you an appointment for clinic. Apparently having the Myeloma meant you were more at risk of this.\n",
      "ICE:\n",

You get a bit of acid reflux and take a tablet for that in the morning.\n",

      "You live with your husband, who has been really supportive throughout all of this. He is your rock and you don’t know what you would do without him. You are usually quite active, but the chemotherapy absolutely knocked you out, so you were too tired to do anything. This meant that you’ve spent most of the last two months on the sofa.

      "“My primary diagnosis would be a respiratory cause, specifically pulmonary embolism. This is due to the acute history of shortness of breath, haemoptysis and pleuritic sounding chest pain. The patient has multiple risk factors for PE, including malignancy and recent immobility. An alternative diagnosis to consider would be an infective cause: pneumonia.

You had hoped it would settle over time, but you’ve never seen blood before, and this has got you a bit worried. Over the past few months, maybe even just over a year now you think about it, your waterworks have been giving you a lot of trouble. It started off with just struggling to start passing water. It got slowly worse, and you you’re up all through the night trying to get a bit of a trickle out. You’ve had episodes of burning when you pass water, which clears up with the antibiotics the GP gives you. Apart from that you’re feeling fine – you’re very fit for you age.

There isn’t any pattern to this, and you passed it off as morning sickness although you’re aware that it’s a bit late on in the pregnancy for that. You haven’t really suffered with sickness until now. You’ve been getting a little bit of tummy pain just under your ribs, it’s not too severe, just a bit of a dull ache and you just thought it was just the baby pressing on things inside.

      "You are Steph O’Scope, an 81 year old lady who lives with her husband on a farm. You’ve lived there for 50 years in peace, and you have been getting a little bit stressed recently. This is because you don’t like change, but life seems to be very different than it appeared 5 years ago. Your main problem is that you are the carer for your husband, Dermot. \n",
      "Dermot suffers from dementia, and he depends on you to look after him. You need to be with him 24/7, which you admit has become a little bit overwhelming recently. However, you love him dearly and he has always been therefore you, through thick and thin.\n",
      "HPC: Things have been thrown into chaos in the last 2 weeks since you had a fall at home, on the farm. You don’t remember much from the fall. You had a vague experience of light-headedness, and then you must have tripped over your own feet. You’ve been doing that a lot recently, and feel quite silly about it. You don’t think you hit your head when you fell, but you did fall onto your left side, where you hurt yourself quite badly.\n",
      "The pain was one of the worst you have ever experienced, and you think it shot down your left leg towards your knee. You weren’t able to get up after that, and you reckon you were lying on the floor for around 1 hour. Luckily, your daughter was stopping by that afternoon to bring in the shopping, and she found you on the floor and brought you to hospital.\n",
      "In hospital, they told you that you had broken your hip, and you had an operation. That bit of your memory is really hazy and you can’t quite recall what happened in hospital: it was all a blur of worry and pain. You just remember being devastated that you couldn’t go home straight from hospital, and that the doctors insisted that you come to this rehabilitation ward instead.\n",
      "At the moment, you feel well again. You were a little confused for a time at hospital, but now you can think clearly. Your pain is well controlled, though you haven’t opened your bowels in about a week. You suspect that this is down to the painkillers, but aren’t quite sure. These doctors don’t tell you anything!\n",
      "ICE: Your main concern is obviously for Dermot, who is at home being cared for by your daughter. You were loathe to leave him, however, and apparently you did try to self-discharge from the acute hospital when you weren’t quite well. However your daughter tells you that you that the doctors wouldn’t let you as you weren’t yourself. You’re still desperate to get home to care for Dermot, however.\n",
      "Your daughter tells you that you fell because you took on too much in caring for Dermot and that he should be cared for by a ‘qualified nursing home’. Not a chance!\n",

      "SH: You live in a farm house with your husband, Dermot. Your daughter comes to visit every week, but this seems to have become more frequent recently. The house has stairs so you and Dermot have had to move everything downstairs this year, since he can’t manage to climb stairs. Your doctor has previously recommended moving, however you don’t want to leave the home you have lived in for so long: somewhere where you have so many happy memories.\n",

You vomited once before coming to hospital and twice sat in the waiting room. If asked where the pain is specifically, it is right in the middle of your abdomen, above your belly button, but you can also feel it all the way through to your back. It feels like you’ve been stabbed. You have realised if you sit forward it eases the pain a bit. You’ve taken 2 Rennies but they haven’t really helped. You’re feeling very hot and a bit sweaty and just want it all to go away! You haven’t noticed any changes in the colour of your skin, bowel motions or urine.

Originally you put the shortness of breath down to being unfit, but it has just got worse and worse. You get breathless now going up the stairs at home!\n",
      "Thankfully, you’re not breathless when you’re sitting or lying down. You have had a cough alongside this, but haven’t brought anything up with it. You spoke to your friend, who is a pharmacist, and they reckoned it was viral, so you haven’t bothered too much with it. You haven’t coughed up any blood or anything scary like that. Not even anything green! The cough seems pretty dry actually, you’ve had to keep going forward and back to the water-cooler at the office. This is getting you in trouble with your manager as he thinks you are trying to avoid work!\n",
      "You’ve been feeling pretty tired alongside all of this. You suspect that this is likely due to your job. The job is in a call centre in a town which is one hour’s drive away, so the commute is becoming overwhelming. You hate the job itself, and have considered quitting due to all of this. You are always waking up early in the morning feeling drained. Sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat.\n",
      "You saw your mum at the weekend and she was commenting that you looked really thin: but not in a good way. She reckoned that your face was quite thin, which was strange because you haven’t done any exercise lately. She proceeded to treat you to a seven-course dinner. You made a note to have a thin face more often!\n",
      "In terms of other problems, you haven’t noticed that much. You have quite a few bruises on your legs. This used to be really common when you played volleyball, but you haven’t done any contact sport or fallen over in a while, so you’re not sure how you managed to pick those up. You haven’t had any chest pain, tummy pain or joint pain. Your bowels and waterworks are absolutely fine – though you’re weeing more because you’re drinking so much water!\n",

This is because of the shortness of breath, dry cough, malaise and night sweats in a patient who is relatively young. This is accompanied by weight loss, which is also a symptom of sarcoidosis. However the red flag symptoms here would make me concerned about my second differential: a malignant cause. Specifically lymphoma given the night sweats, or lung cancer given the shortness of breath.  Finally, an infective cause should be considered: tuberculosis. This also presents with the aforementioned symptoms, however this is less likely due to lack of risk factors in the history.”\n",

It may be useful to highlight that Si isn’t immediately dying, but now is a sensible time to make sure decisions have been made incase he deteriorates now or in future.

      "The third time you were pregnant was 8 years ago (when you were 26). You had another girl, this time weighing 9lb 3oz at 38 weeks. You had put quite a bit of weight in between pregnancies so the midwife had to do a “sugar test” because of your size. The test showed that your sugars were high and you had to make sure you ate really healthily to control them.

You have had increasing difficulty doing buttons up whilst getting dressed and also with writing. Recently you have also struggled to open your daily can of Diet Coke at lunch. This morning, whilst making breakfast, you were unable to open the jar of peanut butter, which seemed like a little thing, but was very distressing.

You have been working long hours, and might have skipped a lunch or two, but haven’t been trying to lose weight or anything. You haven’t had time to go to the gym, something you used to love to do.

      "HPC:\n",
      "This all started six weeks ago, when you began to feel rubbish: tired all the time and then feeling hot and cold. At around the same time you picked up this cough. You went to the GP with it after a couple of weeks.\n",
      "At first the GP told you it was a virus, and would go away. However, it didn’t go away at all. You started bringing up white stuff with the cough, and the tiredness got worse. This really confused you, because you haven’t really been doing anything too strenuous since you retired.\n",
      "You take ages to get up in the morning, and have started taking long naps in the afternoon. In the evening and during the night you sometimes feel really hot and sweaty – once your girlfriend had to get up and sleep in a different bed because you absolutely drenched the sheets!\n",
      "You have been a little more breathless when getting about, but you put this down to the cold the doctor said you have. You’re not breathless normally when you’re just sat down. You haven’t coughed up any blood and haven’t had any chest pain, or anything scary like that.\n",
      "Your girlfriend has commented lately that you have lost a bit of weight. You think that this is because you used to have a pastie or two after your morning post round, but now you can’t be bothered to leave the house, so haven’t had as much rubbish food. Come to think of it, you haven’t been eating too much at all lately: you just pick at your food.\n",
      "You haven’t been around anyone who is unwell, so you’re not sure where you picked this up from. Your waterworks have been absolutely fine, whilst you have been a little bit constipated lately. You haven’t had any falls, and don’t remember being confused at any point.\n",
      "ICE:\n",
      "You’re worried by the reaction of your GP when you went to see him last. He said he wanted you to come straight in for some tests because of these temperatures, and because you have big swollen glands in your neck. You hadn’t noticed that yourself! You hope it’s not a bad infection.\n",
      "PMH:\n",
      "You’ve been generally healthy all your life: you retired a little early because your knees had a bit of arthritis in them, and your eyesight isn’t what it once was. Otherwise, you have always been reasonably healthy! You don’t take any regular tablets.\n",
      "You’ve never had any vaccinations in the past. Your aunt, who brought you up when you were young, never believed in them, so neither do you.\n",
      "SH:\n",
      "You live in a terraced house, and your girlfriend comes to stay at the weekends, since she lives and works far away. You enjoy having her company as you don’t have many friends: you’ve become much more of a reclusive person lately. Whilst initially you put that down to enjoying the peace and quiet of retirement, now you just feel a little bit too tired to get about as much. You can’t be bothered.\n",
      "You smoked for about twenty years – smoking a pipe – but gave up about five years ago. You have a couple of glasses of brandy on an evening, but no more than that. You find it helps you sleep now.\n",
      "You haven’t been around anyone unwell, and haven’t eaten anything concerning. You haven’t been abroad in years – who has the time? – and have had the same partner for the past 2 years.\n",

      "The student should take a focused history of the patient with unexplained febrile illness. This should include red flags for malignancy and risk factors for infection.

      "A reasonable differential diagnosis could include:\n",
      "My differential diagnosis would be a haematological cause: more specifically a lymphoma. This could then be further categorised upon investigation. My reasoning behind this would be a history of night sweats, weight loss and generalised febrile illness for over five weeks. An alternative diagnosis would be an infective cause: more specifically infectious mononucleosis or tuberculosis. These share the symptoms I have just mentioned. However, there are no clear risk factors for infection in this individual, though he has not received the BCG vaccination.

      "You are Gerry Attrix, a 41 year old phlebotomist at the local hospital. It has been quite a distressing few days, culminating in you having to be admitted to hospital for your symptoms. You feel it’s all the more embarrassing that you’ve been treated by work colleagues!\n",
      "HPC:\n",
      "You first noticed your symptoms one week ago, when you developed diarrhoea. At first it was clear and smelly, however soon you noticed blood staining the pan and the stool. There was not a lot of blood: about a teacup-full. Every time you opened your bowels, this was accompanied by a crampy tummy pain which shot to both your flanks. The pain was worst around 3 days ago, but now it has largely settled.\n",
      "What is most distressing is that you are opening your bowels more and more often. Normally you go only once every couple of days, but things have been getting out of control! You’ve even been getting up in the middle of the night to run to the toilet. You haven’t had any accidents, thankfully, but it is still extremely disruptive. You’ve obviously needed to take the week off work due to this. Yesterday you opened your bowels 20 times!\n",
      "It’s not just toilet symptoms that you’ve been experiencing. You’ve felt exhausted for about a month. Originally you had put this down to the short-staffing situation at work, however the tiredness has just got worse and worse, despite making extra effort to get more sleep.\n",
      "You haven’t had any problems with vomiting. You have also not experienced any chest pain or urine problems. You have, however, noticed that your phlebotomy uniform has been getting baggier – you’ve had to order a new one! You’re not sure if this is down to you losing weight – you haven’t been trying to do so – or if it’s your boss buying uniforms on the cheap again!\n",
      "You also haven’t noticed any rashes, bruising or vision changes.\n",

      "You have no idea what is going on. Originally you had traced back your eating habits, since you felt it could be food poisoning. But you haven’t eaten anything out of the ordinary, and none of the other staff have been sick after eating the hospital food! Your aunt has a wheat intolerance, and your partner felt you could have inherited this: but you had this checked out at the GP last year and he told you that was negative.\n",
      "Going forward, you’re obviously quite concerned as to how you’re coping with this illness. Your job is your life and being unable to do is really upsets you. You also feel like you’re letting the already short-staffed side down when you can’t come to work. Furthermore the embarrassment of this illness is definitely affecting your dignity: you’re quite proud of the way you look and running to the toilet has completely ruined your pride and how you hold yourself. You just feel rubbish.\n",
      "PMH:\n",
      "You haven’t had any medical problems in the past. This kind of episode has happened once before, six months ago. You were about to go into hospital for the illness, but it went away by itself. There was no blood on that occasion, it was simply diarrhoea and tiredness.\n",

To make matters worse, you began to experience frequent episodes of vomiting and began to feel absolutely rubbish, and you just could not explain why. This is why you presented to hospital.\n",

You choose to lie in bed all day rather than facing going out as the pain is crippling.\n",

The pain occurs in your lower tummy but you can’t pinpoint a particular area that is worse. It is a severe cramping pain that comes in waves. It sometimes goes to your back and to the tops of your legs. In between periods you have a dull ache felt in your lower abdomen on most days; this is tolerable but very uncomfortable.\n",

Most of your friends have now had babies of their own and you feel like you’re losing out and falling behind your friends, unable to share in their joy because of your own jealousy. This has been made worse by the fact that Arthur’s tests came back normal and so you feel guilty as you feel like you are the problem, and you’re holding Arthur back from having a child.\n",

You’ve never really thought about the problems you’ve had with periods until now, and you are convinced that there is a link between the period pain and the inability to conceive.\n",

You are looking forward to finishing for the weekend and your final patient is Miss O’Cin, a 32-year-old female who has come in for a follow up appointment for some wrist and finger pain. She currently takes lymecycline 408mg BD and had an intra-articular steroid injection from your GP supervisor two weeks ago for wrist pain. Please take a history and perform an appropriate examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are Miss O’Cin, a 32-year-old primary school teacher. You are Caucasian and live with your girlfriend, Sarah who works as a stewardess on an international airline.\n",
      "HPC: You have come in because you have been getting persistent pain in your right wrist. You first noticed some discomfort around six months ago, however the pain appeared to settle down by itself.  At this time, you didn’t fall or injure your wrist. Around two months ago, you feel that the pain became severe again. At the moment it is located in the centre of your right wrist. You also have a swollen and tender right 1st digit, which has only come on over the past week or so.\n",
      "You have also experienced some stiffness in your wrists and fingers. This is starting to affect you every day. You haven’t noticed any wrist swelling, however your finger is markedly swollen and tender. You would describe the pain as a 5/10 ‘throbbing’ pain. If asked, you think that you may have had some lower back and buttock pain in the past, but you have put up with this and managed it at home.\n",
      "You are starting to feel frustrated. You have been to the doctors about this problem multiple times. You were initially told to try some paracetamol, but that has no effect on the pain at all! You received an injection to your wrist a few weeks ago, and this initially helped the pain significantly. Since then however you have notice a swollen finger and the wrist pain is returning.\n",
      "Apart from your joint and skin problems you feel fit and well.\n",
      "ICE: You have recently been marking lots of exercise books and papers as your class have had exams. You wonder if this has contributed to the worsening pain. You are hoping that you can get something else to take for the pain as it is now stopping you from going to your weekly yoga class. You’re worried that there might be something else going on, such as rheumatoid arthritis as your grandmother had an arthritic condition.\n",
      "PMH: You rarely went to the doctors as a child but over the past few years you have attended more frequently. You have noticed some dry skin over the past few years and you were started on an acne medication by a locum GP you saw last year.  You were surprised you were told you have acne as you very rarely get spots and it is usually patches of dry skin that cause you to feel self-conscious.\n",
      "DH: Lymecycline 408mg BD. No known allergies.\n",
      "FH: Your father has high blood pressure. Your grandmother had a type of arthritis but you’re not sure which kind. Your mother left home when you were very young so you’re unsure of any family history on her side.\n",
      "SH: You live in a rented flat with your girlfriend. You only smoke socially when you are on a night out. You tend to drink 1 bottle of wine per week and every pay day you go out with your friends and tend to drink excessively. You feel like your diet is ok. You went through a phase at university where you were vegetarian but this is no longer the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please observe the student taking a history from this patient. Ideally, they should perform a hand and wrist examination. You should ask them to present their findings to you, with a list of possible differentials. An ideal list of differentials would look something like: “My primary differential diagnosis would be an oligoarticular arthropathy, specifically, psoriatic arthritis, due to the inflammatory pattern associated with this patient’s wrist pain. She also has a family history of joint disease. I would also consider a polyarticular arthropathy such as rheumatoid arthritis, however this patient has signs and symptoms of dactylitis – a fusiform swelling of an entire digit and a history of what sounds like sacroiliac pain, both of which are not associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, it sounds like she has been misdiagnosed with acne vulgaris and has actually been developing skin features of psoriasis, which would also be in keeping with my diagnosis.\n",
      "Topics for discussion may include: - ‘What blood tests can you use to diagnose inflammatory arthropathies?– What are the x-ray features of psoriatic arthritis? - What are the risk factors for psoriatic arthritis? – How would you manage this patient in primary care? –Is it appropriate to refer this patient or would you trial some medications first?’\n",

You are terrified that you become contaminated every time you touch something and have to go and wash your hands every time you touch a door handle or a table.\n",
      "Because your hands don’t feel clean enough after just one wash, you have to do it four times over each time you wash.

When you were very young, you were told that you have something called ‘Cystic Fibrosis’, which means that you produce a lot more thick mucus, and makes it hard to breath sometimes. This also means that you get lots of infections and have to go to hospital quite frequently. This has meant that you’ve missed a lot of school, which you think is a real pain, since you quite like school.\n",

They said that you weren’t keen to eat as much, and didn’t put on weight as you were expected. You were rushed into hospital when you were a few weeks old, with a chest infection. Your mum has told you that you needed to get all kinds of special medicine, but you came through it ok.\n",

You remember that your mum was really worried at the time: she always worries, but that time she was extra stressed!\n",
      "In your day to day life, your body is affected by this condition. You find it difficult to go to the toilet and are constipated often. When you do go, you produce really smelly poo.

You worry that it will affect your schoolwork, however, as you had to take a lot of time out of school last year, which meant that you really fell behind. You really like science and missed out on the school science day last year, which really annoyed you! You like to play football with your school team, but when your chest is bad you can’t keep up with the other boys. This is starting to become more and more of a problem. When your classmates are ill, your mum tells you to stay away from them, as you could get sick too. You want to be a doctor one day, so this worries you sometimes: you want to help sick people!\n",

At first you thought it was just a phase and it would pass, and you managed to carry on through the episodes. However over the last month in particular, it’s got a whole lot worse. You get worried about doing almost anything. On leaving the house, you’re worried you’ll come to harm in some way. On making dinner, you’re scared that your oven will explode and you haven’t used the oven in days. You’re terrified that your children will get abducted if you let them play outside, even in your own fenced garden. And these are just a few examples.\n",

      "The symptoms began about two days ago, during your first week of clinical attachments of your final year of medical school. You developed a horrible headache over the course of a few hours and had to go home early. At the time, you reckoned that it was a delayed hangover – you had one or two drinks on a quiet night out at the weekend.\n",
      "The headache is all over the place and not worse on bending, coughing or looking at bright lights. You have not noticed any neck stiffness – this was the first thing you looked out for! Nothing seems to make it better or worse and you would rate it 6/10. You’ve searched your body for a rash – even getting your girlfriend to have a look(!) – but haven’t spotted anything.\n",
      "Around the same time you started to get diarrhoea. You went to the toilet 4 times yesterday and your stool was very runny. It is yellow/brown in colour and you have not noticed any blood or mucus. You have also had a generalised, cramping abdominal pain for the past two days. It does not spread anywhere, nothing seems to make it better or worse and you would rate it 5/10. Your flatmate cooked his infamously dodgy vindaloo curry the other night, which you thought might have been causing these symptoms. Now, however, you’re starting to worry that things might be a lot more sinister.\n",
      "You have also had a dry cough, which started around the same time as the other symptoms. You have not brought up any phlegm or blood and you are not short of breath or experiencing chest pain.\n",
      "You have also felt very feverish over the past two days. You notice that it seems to come in waves where you feel hot and cold and go very shaky. You have also felt very weak and all of your muscles ache as if you had the flu.\n",
      "PMH: You had asthma and eczema as a child but have since grown out of it.\n",
      "DH: You are on no current medication and you have no drug allergies.\n",
      "FH: You have no relevant family history\n",
      "SH: \n",
      "You have never smoked and you only drink on a Saturday night when you go out with your housemates and drink “a few trebles”. You have never used any IV drugs.\n",
      "You returned from your elective one week ago. You spent 8 weeks in rural Tanzania where you were providing medical aid to small villages. You stayed in a hut in the village with the rest of the medical team. It was a really rewarding experience and you really feel that you made a big difference to the lives of the local people.\n",
      "You then travelled to Zanzibar for another two weeks with your friends, where you stayed in a backpacker’s hostel. You made sure to take your malaria prophylaxis tablets and use a mosquito net at night, although you did sometimes forget to put on insect repellent during the day. You did not go swimming in any freshwater lakes or go on any hikes while you were there. You did take part in some watersports (waterskiing and scuba diving) whilst in Zanzibar. You do not think it was anything you ate as you ate the same as your friends and they are not ill. You did not have any sexual contact – your girlfriend back home would kill you! - or take any illicit drugs whilst you were abroad. You’ve never had any needlestick injuries, thankfully. You had all of your immunisations before you went.\n",
      "ICE: \n",
      "Originally, you thought this was just a bit of a hangover, or food poisoning. However, one of the other students suggested that you might have picked this up on your elective, and this has made you terrified and present straight away. Your main worry is that, because you are so tired all the time at the moment, this could be Trypanosomiasis, African Sleeping Sickness. You keep going over and over again in your head whether you were bitten by any dodgy flies.\n",
      "You are worried because you feel very ill and this is making you miss the beginning of your final year of medical school. \n",
      "You would like to know what is causing this illness and receive treatment as soon as you can so that you can return to your studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The student should take a focused infection history, covering all risk factors for infection including a travel history, contacts, occupation, animal contacts and sexual history. There may be a multitude of relevant examinations, however gastrointestinal examination perhaps would be most relevant. Thorough inspection would be important, regardless of the examination, therefore a dermatological examination may also be relevant.\n",
      "Ask the student to present their findings and their differential diagnosis, which should sound similar to the following:\n",
      "“My differential diagnosis would consist of infective causes. Specifically, the most likely diagnosis would be malaria, given the pattern of pyrexia and travel history. I would also want to consider other mosquito-related infections, such as dengue fever or chikungunya. The loose stools may also be caused by an infective gastroenteritis, which could be viral or bacterial in nature.”\n",
      "Points for discussion:\n",

      "Amlodipine OD, Salbutamol PRN, Seretide 500 Accuhaler (fluticasone with salmeterol)\n",

      "You are Matt Formin, a 68 year old happily retired plumber. You live with your wife and three dogs, Pippin, Daisy and Oscar- you like to joke that the dogs were a replacement for your children when they moved out a few years ago!\n",
      "HPC: You have come in because you have been getting more breathless recently. Your wife was the first to notice that you kept stopping to catch your breath when you were walking the dogs. You have COPD, so you thought that it was that, but your inhalers haven’t made any difference, and it’s been getting worse and worse over the past three months. You’ve got to the point where you can’t get around the supermarket or go upstairs without having to take breaks, which is making your wife worried.\n",
      "Over this time you’ve also been getting pain in your right side and back around your ribs. It is constant and isn’t affected by anything that you do. It is dull and aching and seems to be getting worse. You tried taking paracetamol and ibuprofen, but they don’t help and it is affecting your sleep.\n",
      "You have been feeling ‘knackered’ for the past few weeks, and you’ve lost a stone in weight since all this started. In the past week you’ve been waking up to find the bedsheets soaked with sweat. Your wife is annoyed because she has to keep changing the sheets, but you can’t control it!\n",
      "You have a cough, which has been worse this week. You bring up a little white phlegm with it, but never any blood. You haven’t noticed a wheeze or any other problems.\n",
      "ICE: You wonder if you might have picked up a chest infection. You are hoping that you can get some antibiotics and be on your way. You don’t like to dwell on it, but one of your old work mates had a similar thing a couple of years ago and it turned out to be lung cancer. You think it’s unlikely, but it’s part of why you really thought you should come to the doctors.\n",

Your house in on a hill, and you’re fine going down, but getting back up is a struggle. You smoke 10 cigarettes a day, which you’ve done since you began working in the shipyards at 16. You worked in there for 5 years, and then as a plumber until you retired 2 years ago. You were exposed to asbestos a lot in the shipyards and on building sites over the years. You never had any protective gear for this. You have two children, a son and a daughter, who are both in their twenties and moved out a few years ago. You drink 8-10 pints a week, mainly at the weekends.\n",

I would also consider non-small cell or small cell lung cancer, due to the dyspnoea, weight loss and night sweats. Other differentials would include tuberculosis, or cancer elsewhere that has metastasised to the lungs, however this is less likely given the lack of other symptoms and presence of chest pain.”\n",

She comes to this clinic every six months, and has come today to discuss the impact that her condition is having on her life.\n",

      "\n",
      "You are Barbara Bituitz, a 60-year-old lady with a long-term respiratory condition called bronchiectasis. You don’t 100% understand what this means but you know it makes you breathless, cough up a lot of phlegm and makes you catch infections frequently. You were a secondary school teacher, but retired last year due to worsening health, which you were quite disappointed about as you were hoping to work for a bit longer as you loved your job. You live with your husband locally and your two daughters and their families live about 20 minutes away so you are able to see them often.\n",
      "HPC:\n",
      "You’ve had bronchiectasis for about five years now. You had an awful bout of pneumonia five years ago and were in hospital for almost two weeks. It was the most sick you’d ever been. After you were well enough to go home, it was like the pneumonia was still hanging around. You were coughing quite a lot, and began producing more and more disgusting green phlegm although you couldn’t understand why. You put up with this for about a year because you thought it was just a nasty bug that was going to hang around for a while, and you dislike bothering your doctor, but eventually your daughters convinced you to go to your GP. They had noticed you becoming more breathless, and coughing a lot more. At this point you were bringing up about a teaspoon of phlegm every time you coughed, and you were coughing quite a lot!\n",
      "Your GP sent you for some tests. You had a chest x-ray and a CAT scan where you had to be put through a big machine, like a tunnel. You also had to do some funny tests where you had to blow into a tube to test your lungs. You had to go and see the lung doctors who told you that you had this condition. You were a bit annoyed when he said that you might be coughing like this now forever, you thought that you could cure things like this.\n",
      "In the last four years since you were diagnosed, things have gotten gradually worse. You’re coughing a large amount of phlegm up now, you think about half a cup-full a day. Your breathing isn’t great- you’re able to do a lot less now. You used to love walking but now you can’t walk for more than about half an hour slowly before you get too breathless. You’ve been in hospital about 5 times with bad infections; this year you’ve been in twice already (once three weeks ago) with awful chest infections. You’ve never coughed up blood thankfully!\n",
      "ICE:\n",
      "The last chest infection you had was one of the more awful ones you’ve had. You were in hospital for about a week and for a lot of that you just couldn’t breathe at all- it was really frightening and you’re really concerned about it happening again as you’re scared it may kill you.\n",
      "You find the condition very frustrating to live with. You hate that you’re unable to do anything any more – you miss walking in the countryside and the fresh air and you didn’t expect it to get this bad when you were first diagnosed. Although you’ve had the condition for five years now nobody has really explained what it is to you and you think that it’s a constant infection. You’ve become less inclined to play with your grandchildren, the youngest is only 6 months old and you think that you’ll pass something on if you stay around them too long.\n",
      "The fact that there hasn’t been a treatment that’s fixed you yet makes you quite upset. You always come to appointments hoping and expecting there to be a new treatment that will mend you and are always disappointed when there isn’t. You think that inhalers are for children with asthma, as lots of the school children used to have them, and can’t understand why you have one,.

Her condition has worsened over a period of years, and there seems to be an obvious infective cause. Due to Barbara’s lack of smoking history, COPD would become less likely.

      "A lot of this case is going to come from body language and non-verbal communication so this is going to have both your ICE but also some behaviour cues to help. Speak quietly and in perfunctory sentences. Avoid eye contact, either looking at the ground or focussing on your hands. Give limited information making it obvious you’re holding something back. When pressed on it, snap angrily then get upset at the fact that you snapped. Be teary and easily startled throughout. \n",

      "Initially you just say that you think you’ve just started to drink excessively as a habit- you actually think you’re drinking to cope and try and drown out the thoughts. You’re worried that this will continue and that eventually you’ll spiral down so far you’ll become a recluse or kill yourself. You are scared of how much control your ex-husband still has in your life even after you had thought you’d managed to escape his grasp. You don’t expect anything from this, you’re pretty sure you’re too far gone for help at this point but its worth a shot.\n",
      "History of Presenting Complaint\n",
      "You have come to the GP because you’re drinking too much alcohol and its getting in the way of your ability to think. You drink a bottle of wine over the course of three days, white wine approximately 11%. You do not take break days and instead find yourself drinking every day. You don’t really get angry when other people question your drinking since you don’t really have anybody else to notice it.\n",
      "You’ve been isolating yourself more and more. You can’t really trust anyone else or yourself either. You’re scared that the people you care about might actually be there to hurt you and you’re even more scared of strangers. You haven’t left the house in over a week now except for this trip to the GP. Even then it took three attempts to work up the courage to leave the house. You don’t trust yourself to be normal outside since you’ve been getting worse and worse mood swings. Your best friend mentioned getting worried and you just shouted at her. You’re also exhausted since you’re getting no sleep at all, you feel like you can’t relax since you don’t feel safe. When you finally manage to fall asleep you get the worst nightmares. You’ve since added a second lock to the door.\n",
      "You have been getting flashbacks to your ex-husband. He was a mean and violent drunk. You do wonder if there was anything you could’ve done or any way you could’ve been better so that he wouldn’t have hurt you. Sometimes you day dream about getting revenge but you don’t think you’ll be able to.\n",
      "You’ve not had any suicidal thoughts. You’re feeling more and more detached from people. In fact, you’ve given up all your hobbies and barely talk to anyone now. You struggle to concentrate at times. You have not had any hallucinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very difficult case for the student. Here the focus is on communication skills and ability to build a rapport with the patient. If they take a superficial history exclusively on alcohol despite the hints dropped by the patient then they have missed the point of the exercise. Additionally, if they probe too hard on this initial meeting they risk damaging the doctor patient relationship. A fine line indeed!\n",
      "Appropriate differential diagnoses are PTSD, Depression with Agoraphobia, Complicated grief reaction, and Enduring personality change after trauma. These can be added to a degree of alcohol dependence as well.\n",
      "Management plan should include continuing a strong doctor-patient relationship (since this can only be treated if the relationship is built on mutual trust), trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy, Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), stress management information, relaxation therapies and addressing the alcohol dependence. Drug treatment is second line and it is less useful for it to be mentioned at this point.\n",
      "Example questions and answers:\n",
      "What are risk factors for PTSD? Exposure to trauma or combat, refugee/asylum seeker status, first responder occupation, combat specific (duration of exposure, low morale, poor social support, lower rank, unmarried, low educational attainment, childhood adversity), previous psychiatric disorders.\n",
      "Is PTSD the same for everyone? No it is not. Some people may develop some form of it following an event which self-resolves in 6 months. Others will only develop one of the three key symptoms (Hypervigilance, flashbacks and rumination). There is also a cultural\n",
      "aspect to it which might lead to people presenting with medically unexplained symptoms rather than a direct psychological complaint.\n",
      "Which neurotransmitter is involved in the fight or flight response? Adrenaline.\n",

You haven’t actually been out of the house in the last 3 days, which is unusual for you as most nights you go to the pub with your friends.

You’ve got quite a high pain threshold, and you’re used to the arthritis pain, but this is something different. You haven’t injured the knee at all recently or fallen over.

He seemed like a useless GP: you’ve been meaning to change practices for a while now. However, this has made you very frustrated and worried that Levi might have something dangerous.\n",

He was slow to grow when he was a baby, but caught up in the end. Due to this, you keep a close eye on his weight: it hasn’t changed recently. He had all his injections, even though Levi’s dad wasn’t keen on him getting the MMR, as he thought it might have some funny chemicals in it. You told him that that was silly!

It is a dull ache in your low back associated with stiffness; notably, you used to be able to touch your toes and now you can barely get to your knees. You’re usually fit and active though recently have been doing less exercise, due to the pain but also due to stress at work. A week ago, you did notice that when playing squash against a colleague from work, your heel seemed quite sore.

She has also felt quite hot to touch: your thermometer is broken but she felt scorching! Obviously this set off alarm bells for you. Then there is the cough. There’s no phlegm or anything, but it just sounds odd. It’s really harsh and hacking: it sounded just like Jake, your corgi, when he barks! This cough seems to be worse at night and as such Di has got much sleep latterly and is more agitated then usual. She’s not the only one! Over the last couple of hours, she has started becoming short of breath and you have noticed a noise when she breathes in. This has terrified you, so you have brought her straight into A&E.

      "HPC: She fell off the bike about 6 hours ago and hasn’t been moving it since, but she hasn’t really been complaining about it, in fact she’s been quite quiet since you’ve been home from work. You’re glad she hasn’t been crying because your youngest, 1 month old Harry, hasn’t been sleeping and you don’t want him to be woken up. She’s clutching her arm and when you ask Meghan if it hurts, she just nods and doesn’t say anything. Nothing is helping, even her Elsa doll (she loves Frozen, its on in the house all the time and she wanted Harry to be called Olaf). It’s not cheering her up or making her feel better. \n",
      "She’s got stabilisers on her bike still You’ve not been able to teach her how to ride as you’ve been a single mum for years and have to work a lot, but your new boyfriend Jason said he’ll take her out and teach her. He’s been great at watching the kids while you’re at work, especially since it’s been half term. \n",
      "The fall happened while you were at work, so you didn’t see it. Jason told you about it when you got home, he says she was showing off on her bike and was going too fast and hit the curb. He says she was fine at the time, but things must have gotten worse as the day went on, because now she’s really quiet and obviously in pain. That’s why you brought her in, Jason was going out tonight so he couldn’t come with you. \n",
      "You haven’t noticed any other injuries, other than the usual knocks and bruises you’d expect for a kid her age. She’s a handful and that’s all part of being a kid and growing up. You think she’s maybe had a few more bruises recently, since the baby and then Jason moving in, but Jason thinks she’s just been playing a bit rougher and “showing off” to get attention because she’s jealous of the new baby. You’ve not had a good look at her recently, Jason is often the one to bath Meghan and put her to bed if you’re busy with Harry or working shifts. It’s often after bedtime when you get home. \n",
      "PMH: Meghan was born at term by normal delivery with no complications, and she’s fully vaccinated.

You started a relationship about 3 months ago and he wanted to move in and help with the kids, since their dad isn’t really involved much. He moved in about a month ago and you feel very luck that someone would want to take on both you and the kids \n",
      "You wanted to take more time off work when you had Harry, as he’s only a month old, but you work in a care home and they’re short staffed and you need the money so you had to go back to work. Jason doesn’t work at the moment, so it’s easier and cheaper for him to watch the kids than paying for childcare, and you don’t have any relatives close by who could help. \n",
      "Nobody smokes in the house. Jason usually has a couple of cans of lager every night, but you don’t drink. \n",

      "ICE: You weren’t worried, sometimes children go through phases especially when there’s been a big change so the new baby and Jason moving in probably explains the rough play and change in Meghan’s behaviour recently. \n",
      "You trust Jason and don’t think this has anything to do with him. You’re hurt and offended that anyone would dare suggest that you or him might have hurt your daughter. You’re glad he’s not with you to hear this, because he’d be furious and it’d probably drive a wedge between you if something like this happened. \n",

You get breathless lying down in bed too, so have been sleeping propped up on pillows. Walking and climbing stairs is made even more difficult by the fact that you are achey all over, and your feet and lower legs have started swelling up. This has also been going on for around 4-6 weeks. The aching feels like it’s in your bones and is worst in your arms and legs.\n",

It is not associated with eating and nothing really makes it better. The shortness of breath is also worst when you are lying flat. You think this is down to how big your tummy has got, but you did have a blood clot in your lung a few years ago.\n",

      "ICE: You are concerned that you haven’t got any better the last few times you have been in hospital. You are worried that you have done so much damage already to your liver due to the alcohol, that you won’t get better. You are expecting another needle into your tummy to remove all the fluid in there.\n",
      "PMH: You know you have a long term problem with your liver. You had a blood clot in your lung a few years ago and take a tablet for that. You used to take warfarin but this new tablet means you don’t need to get your blood taken all the time – which is a big relief! You used to have chest pain due to angina but you haven’t had that for a long time. You don’t use that inhaler. You sometimes use a blue inhaler when you’re breathless. It doesn’t really help.\n",

The names of them are unclear but you think they were something like amoxin something and ciprofloxin or something. You felt a lot better and were discharged home. However, yesterday (five days after leaving hospital) you started to get really painful stomach cramps and watery diarrhoea\n",

It is a sharp stabbing pain. \n",

There was no blood in your vomit, and it was just the food you had eaten, no bile or anything like that.  You’ve had a bit of a temperature overnight, feeling hot and cold. You haven’t been shaking or anything like that. You haven’t had anything to eat since yesterday, and even water is struggling to stay down, so now you’re feeling very weak and washed out You’ve taken Paracetamol and ibuprofen but it hasn’t settled the pain.\n",

You’ve had a lot of heartburn, which your doctor says is probably due to a hernia in your stomach, you’ve been started on some tablets which have helped a lot. The pain from the heartburn is different to this pain, as the heartburn you feel up in your chest and get a horrible taste in the back of your throat.\n",

You went to see your GP a few weeks ago as you’ve noticed your heart doing some funny things. About three times now you’ve had periods of becoming extremely aware of your heartbeat; it feels like your heart wants to jump out of your chest and you feel like your pulse is racing. You have also noticed yourself feeling dizzy when these episodes happen and need to sit down for a little while- this has led to you becoming more anxious as you haven’t had much wrong with your health in the past.\n",

You could hear your heartbeat in your head, and felt like your heart was going very fast. You also became a bit dizzy, and had to sit down for about an hour. The dizziness passed and you were able to finish making your banana bread, and you figured that you must have just been a bit tired or not eaten enough that day. Over the next few days you still noticed your pulse racing in your wrist, but as you felt OK you didn’t think much of it. You think that the pulse was like this for about four days.\n",
      "The second time occurred two weeks after the first episode. You were out walking with Alan this time, when you started to feel quite breathless, only about two miles into the walk, and felt like you needed to sit down. Alan was worried, as you are usually very fit, and are stubborn and never like to stop during a walk! You started to feel dizzy, just like the first time with the banana bread and you had that same sensation of feeling your heartbeat in your head. You had to turn around and go home, as you felt too dizzy and breathless to go on.  You managed to sleep the dizziness off, and again you figured you were just tired or hadn’t eaten enough. The next day you felt fine. You didn’t think to feel for your pulse this time.\n",

You started feeling a strange sensation in your chest, not a pain but more a discomfort, and the heartbeat in your head thing happened again. You did feel your pulse this time and it was very, very fast. You finished your shopping quickly and drove home but it was hard to do so as you felt really dizzy. You got in and made yourself a cup of tea and felt a bit better. However the next day your pulse was still racing and you felt a bit worried, as this was the third time such an event had happened so you called your GP.\n",

      "You first noticed the pain whilst walking your five dogs out in the moorlands last summer. It had been a particularly long walk as one of the dogs had ran off and taken you on a massive detour, and so you put the pain down to all the hard effort you’d put in keeping your pets under control! However gradually you’ve noticed the pain has been getting worse (around 6/10, no radiation and no localised knee pain) on shorter walking distances and even around the house, and now your other knee has started hurting too. You sometimes take paracetamol but you find a shot of whiskey is a lot more effective. Your other joints have been OK, and you haven’t noticed any calf pain/skin changes and have had no recent trauma.\n",

Another cause of joint pain would include gout – this gentleman has a family history and lifestyle compatible with this condition, but often gout would affect joints unilaterally and most often the great toe.

      "You are Hallie Peridol, you are 5 and three quarters years old, and in Year 1 at school. You like playing with toy horses and going to ballet classes with your friends. You’re at the doctors because you have a sore leg and you don’t want to stand up because it hurts. It hurts you to stand up, and it hurts just in the top part of your leg and your hip joint.\n",

You’re upset because you are missing school because it is so sore and you’re worried about missing your ballet class in a few days. You’re a bit nervous about being at the doctors as last time you were here you got given an injection which wasn’t very nice.\n",
      "George:\n",
      "You are George Peridol, here today with your 5-year-old daughter Hallie. A few days ago you noticed Hallie walking a bit funny, with a bit of a limp when she came home from school. You asked her but she can’t remember falling over or bumping it, and you checked with the teachers the next morning who don’t report anything having happened at school.\n",
      "Today when you got Hallie up for school, you noticed her hopping down the stairs on her right leg for breakfast. When you asked her to walk properly, she said that she couldn’t because it hurt to put her left foot down. When she tried to show you, she started crying saying it was too painful and immediately sat down and refused to get back up. You’ve had to carry her everywhere since then.\n",
      "Poor Hallie has been through the works the last few weeks- she missed 3 days of school last week due to having a dreadful bug that gave her a bit of a fever, a runny nose and a cough. These symptoms have disappeared, but you did notice her feeling a little warm this morning when you picked her up, although you haven’t measured her temperature.\n",
      "Other than her painful left leg, Hallie has returned to her normal bright self. When she’s sitting down and not having to use the leg, she’s calm, happy and plays normally.\n",
      "ICE\n",
      "You are worried that Hallie has hurt herself at school and broken a bone. Your son Daniel broke his leg last year and wasn’t able to walk on that, and he was in a plaster cast for 6 weeks which wasn’t any fun for any of the family. Daniel had an X-Ray, and you’re thinking Hallie will have the same, and you’re expecting that you’ll leave today with Hallie in a plaster cast. You know Hallie loves dancing, and are concerned that she’ll have to miss her dance show in three weeks, that she’s worked really, really hard for.\n",
      "Developmental History:\n",
      "Hallie was born at 40 weeks. She was a breech baby, but was still able to be delivered vaginally. A day after she was born, the doctor came to check Hallie over, and it was found that her right hip was clicky. She had to be in a strange splint thing for about 6 weeks, and after that she didn’t have any more problems, and she started walking at 1 year.\n",
      "She’s always been quite on target with all her other milestones. You have no worries about social or physical development. She’s always eaten well, and has never been too small or too big. She’s a bright girl, always getting 10/10 on her spellings. She’s up to date with all her vaccinations.\n",

You work as a lawyer with a local firm, and your wife is a secondary school teacher.  Neither of you smoke nor do you let anybody smoke in your home. Both children attend the same local primary school, a five-minute walk from your house. Hallie is a very bright girl and does well at school, and has a lot of friends. There have never been any issues with bullying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The student should take a thorough history of Hallie’s symptoms, gathering information from both Hallie and George, and eliciting the concerns of both, addressing them in an appropriate fashion. An examination of the hip would be appropriate, but a pGALS examination could also be performed.\n",
      "Differential Diagnosis\n",
      "My differential diagnosis would include causes of hip pain and limp in a child. Hallie’s symptoms would fit with a diagnosis of transient synovitis. She is clinically well, with a mild pyrexia, and is recovering from an upper respiratory tract infection. It is important to rule out septic arthritis, due to the destructive nature of this condition, but children tend to be systemically unwell. Other causes of hip pain in a six year old would include Legg-Calve-Perthe’s disease, in which there is avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and juvenile arthritis. These conditions would be expected to have a more gradual onset, over weeks rather than days. Hallie also has a history of developmental dysplasia of the hip, which could cause a limp in a child. However this limp would more likely be painless, have been more longstanding, and from the history, it sounds like this condition was treated early.\n",
      "Discussion Questions:\n",
      "What is transient synovitis?\n",
      "What would be appropriate investigations to carry out in Hallie? What results would you expect?\n",

      "You are Elle Bow, a 75 year old lady with an interest in card games. You’re your country’s reigning bridge champion! However, things have been going downhill in your life over the past year or so, particularly with your health\n",
      "6 months ago you were diagnosed with a cancer of your bile duct. You initially noticed that you were losing weight, and one of your friends at bingo night told you that they noticed that your eyes were yellow. You were astonished at this: your cousin once had this, but he drank a lot of alcohol, so you thought it was down to that. You don’t even drink! You went straight to the doctor and they did some tests. In the end, you got your diagnosis, and were started on chemotherapy. You had your last cycle just last month, and are hoping that this will improve things.\n",
      "HPC:\n",
      "For this hospital admission, you have come in for three reasons. Firstly, your feet are really swollen. They’ve blown up like balloons! You felt like you were a hippo when walking, and it was stopping you getting around. They both have swollen up equally, and it happened relatively quickly, over the past fortnight. They are not read, and are just a bit painful as the skin feels tight.\n",
      "Staying at your legs, your feet have become very tingly, as well as your hands. You’re getting lots of pins and needles, and noticing that it’s quite hard to feel anything touching them from time to time. This has puzzled you and is very frustrating as it’s stopping you playing online card games. \n",
      "Finally your tummy has swollen again. This happened last month, but it’s much worse this time. It feels like you’re pregnant! This has affected your breathing: you now find it quite difficult to lie flat. It’s generally a bit sore, but not over any particular area.\n",
      "You haven’t noticed any difficulty swallowing, any bleeding from anywhere, or any vomiting. You think you would notice those things if they happened: you’re still quite sharp! Your bowel habit is fine and you haven’t had any problems going to the toilet.\n",
      "PMH:\n",
      "You were diagnosed with a bile duct tumour this year and have been on a few cycles of chemotherapy for this. You had previously been very well and hadn’t really been in hospital for many things. You had your gall bladder taken out a few years ago and have had to go for checks on this.\n",
      "ICE:\n",
      "You think that this is the fluid building up in your tummy again. They haven’t put any drains in this time, and are wondering whether they will just bite the bullet and do it quickly this time  instead of messing around. You don’t want to be beaten by the cancer: you’re very knowledgable about what is going on - reading up on everything! You’re not sure what is causing the tingling in your hands. Could it be the chemotherapy?\n",
      "Social history:\n",
      "You live at home alone. You have had a few partners but never married - you’re fiercely independent and want to keep things that way! You have a cat called Toulouse which just gets on and does its own thing. It seems that it’s your spirit animal! You have never drank alcohol to excess - maybe a glass of wine at Christmas - and you don’t smoke. Before these last few weeks, you had been managing at home just fine.\n",

This patient has a number of presenting complaints and a comprehensive past medical history, so it may prove difficult to pin down the most pertinent points, but the excellent candidate will focus in on the abdominal swelling, as is suggested in the question. Candidates may also identify the leg swelling (important to the patient) and the tingling in the hands (peripheral neuropathy) as key features to explore. An abdominal exam would be appropriate. This patient would have ascites and a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.\n",
      "An example differential diagnosis may sound something like:\n",
      "‘My primary differential diagnosis would be a gastrointestinal problem, more specifically ascites secondary to malignancy. This is because of the history of cholangiocarcinoma and the acute abdominal distention. The patient is also experiencing distal limb paraesthesia and numbness - potentially due to peripheral neuropathy secondary to cisplatin chemotherapy. I would also want to rule out metastases potentially causing neurology - including paraneoplastic syndrome or any bowel malignancy.’\n",

      "HPC: You’ve been in hospital 6 days now, and feel like you’re recovering well. You were initially brought in with horrible chest pain. It started while you were walking in the park with your wife and grandson. It felt like someone had put a lead weight on your chest that was crushing you. It radiated up to your neck but nowhere else. You felt very dizzy, short of breath and sweaty. You’ve had angina over the years, but it’s never felt this bad before. You sat down on a bench to catch your breath, but the pain didn’t settle, and your angina spray you always carry with you didn’t help either. At that point you were really worried, and your wife called an ambulance because she said you looked ‘grey’ and as if you were about to faint. \n",
      "You don’t really remember much about what happened after the ambulance came, but you know you were rushed into surgery very quickly. The doctors told you they have put some tubes in somewhere.\n",
      "Since then you’ve been recovering on the cardiology ward. You’ve started getting up and about with the physiotherapists and feel like you’re doing well. You felt a bit sore and shakey at first but that’s settling now. You wrist, where they went in, is sore under the dressing and did ooze a little blood on the first day, but that has now stopped. You developed a chesty cough the day before yesterday and have been a bit feverish. The doctors think you might have picked up a chest infection. They started you on some tablet antibiotics, and you are already feeling better. The only real problem is the food, the vegetarian options are dreadful – so you’ve been getting you wife to bring in some of her cooking instead.\n",
      "ICE: You thought you were having a heart attack, and you were genuinely scared the ambulance wouldn’t reach you in time. You thought you might need an operation, as your brother had to have one last year when he had a heart attack.\n",
      "PMH: Angina, type 2 diabetes (which you’re on tablets for), gout, high blood pressure and an enlarged prostate.\n",
      "FH: You older brother died of a heart attack 5 years ago when he was 71. Your younger brother had a heart attack last year at 61. You’re pretty sure most of your father’s family had heart problems as well. You remember him having heart problems even in his 40s.\n",
      "SH: You smoke 5 cigarettes a day, and have cut down from over a pack a day since you started getting angina. But now you’re going to stop. You don’t drink alcohol. You are a vegetarian. You live with your wife and have lots of family nearby, but have no carers. You usually walk around the shops without stopping, without a stick or anything like that, except when your gout flares up. You own a carpet shop in the town centre with your family, but have essentially retired now and your sons do most of the work.\n",
      "Medications:\n",
      "You’re not really sure what you take each day, as they come in a weekly box from the chemist. You know you have aspirin in there, and a few other tablets for your heart. You also have your spray for when you have angina. You are allergic to a blood pressure tablet beginning with ‘A’, which gave you really swollen ankles.\n",

      "Students should cover both the history of the cardiac sounding chest pain, and the recovery period post operatively.

You’re used to getting abdo pain with your Crohn’s disease but you are feeling really unwell now. The pain is around the middle, and is like someone is stabbing you. You aren’t able to point to where exactly the pain is. It is worse on moving, but doesn’t spread anywhere else. When moving it is 9/10, but if you lie still it is 6-7/10. Eating makes the pain worse.\n",

There are no urinary symptoms, and you are passing small amounts of dark urine. You are feeling very nauseous and have been sick several times. You haven’t eaten anything for over a day and are managing small sips of water only. The vomit is mostly just clear fluid now, there is no blood. You feel clammy, and are just exhausted.

You experienced about two months of bloody diarrhoea that became more and more frequent, and lost about a stone and a half in weight. You also got really painful ulcers in your mouth. This was quite embarrassing for you as a university student and it took you a little while to present. In fact, you didn’t go and see anybody about it until a particularly bad week when you experienced horrific abdominal pains, and very frequent bloody diarrhoea- up to 8 motions a day. You were taken into hospital, as you were very dehydrated. You then had to have a colonoscopy where they took parts of the tissue of your colon to look at under a microscope, which was so embarrassing for you.\n",
      "After your hospital admission you were started on some medications, that you were told would help you recover from this bad episode. There was a steroid medication, and another one called mesalazine.\n",
      "You then had to keep seeing doctors after that. They told you that you had something called “Crohn’s Disease” and that it was a condition where your digestive tract became inflamed, which is what had caused the bleeding and the ulcers. You were told that with medication it could be controlled, but that sometimes it may flare up similar to your recent hospital admission. Your doctor started you on this medication, Azathioprine, that you had to take every day.\n",
      "You had a relapse of disease about six months after diagnosis. As a university student, you didn’t want to have to worry about taking medications and stopped taking your tablets. You also started smoking, and going out a lot more, binge drinking. This episode was similar to the first episode you had, with extreme pain, and never ending bloody diarrhoea. You were started on the steroid tablets and mesalazine again and recovered, but your consultant warned you that acting as you had could allow your disease to get out of control, and that you could end up with a stoma bag if it got too bad. This worried you and you have never smoked, or missed a tablet since.\n",
      "Since then your disease has been relatively well controlled. You have been hospitalised only once since then, with another relapse, a year ago. Several smaller relapses have been treated with an ‘elemental diet’ where you are only allowed to drink this special solution to allow your intestines to recover.\n",

Compared to Harry’s older sister, Harry seems to be “behind schedule” with his development, as he cannot yet crawl.\n",

You have found, however, that this is not the case and are worried he is “running behind schedule”.\n",

      "When asked details, you explain how Harry has not learned how to crawl yet and often cannot stay in the sitting position you try to put him in. At first you thought he seemed too ‘floppy’ as a baby but now he seems almost like he’s resisting movements as his legs seem stiffer than normal. His arms seem to be better developed and he can lift up his head OK. Harry needs a lot of help with feeding as he doesn’t seem very coordinated, although you are impressed that he already knows he is right-handed as he only ever picks things up with his right hand. He seems settled most of the time though, and has started to make sounds. He follows your face but you are unsure if he can hear you yet. You haven’t noticed any changes in his bowels, waterworks, skin or breathing.\n",
      "ICE:\n",

You want him to have the best upbringing possible and to make sure both him and Megan have the same opportunities. You would like them to both go to the same school. You hope this could be corrected with extra playgroups and tuition when he starts school, but as a single parent you are worried about lack of social and financial support for doing this.\n",
      "PMH:\n",
      "Harry is not known to have any other medical conditions. You had Harry when you were 25 years old and had very poor antenatal clinic compliance as you were between moving areas following a break-up with your partner.\n",

There were no post-natal concerns but you have feel you generally haven’t had much interaction with any midwives/community follow-up. You have managed to get Harry’s vaccinations up to date.\n",

Before this, you had happily lived in his flat and looked after Megan whilst he worked as a manager at a large firm. Since you found out you were pregnant, at 22 weeks, you have been rushed off your feet managing to move areas, into a new apartment, and recently now have a job as a teaching assistant at Megan’s school. \n",

      "The student should interact with the child, trying to build rapport with the child using his mother, wherever possible, to keep him calm. Within reason, the student should aim to use materials around him to find out which milestones the child has reached: palmar vs pincer grip picking up objects, sitting in stooped/straight-back position, distracting the child to see if he turns to auditory or visual stimuli. Try to get the child to smile/speak/interact.\n",
      "The student’s differential diagnosis should sound something like:\n",
      "‘My top differential diagnosis would be cerebral palsy, in particular the diplegic category, as his lower limbs seem most affected. Hand dominance before the age of 1 year is always pathological. There is also some evidence of learning difficulty which is associated with cerebral palsy.’ \n",

      "-   What are other causes of motor developmental delay?\n",
      "-   What milestones are often achieved by a 9 month old child?\n",
      "-   What are the four key areas of child development?\n",

You were bullied heavily about it in school, and can remember having fits during class on so many occasions. This continued throughout your twenties, and affected your confidence: you have never felt confident enough to go dating or have a partner for fear they will judge you about your epilepsy. You have long since accepted this, though. You don’t need someone else to make you happy!\n",
      "Things had improved about ten years ago, when your doctor put you on the epilim medicine. This stopped the seizures in their tracks for a good year. What a year it was too: you even went on holiday! However, this honeymoon period fell apart abruptly when you had about six seizures over a few weeks. Since then, you have been upping your epilim dose, and have had something called ‘keppra’ added. That final change was made about three years ago.\n",
      "Things seemed to be going according to plan until around 1 month ago. You were admitted to hospital after a seizure. It came on all of a sudden whilst you were out shopping. You remember reaching over for the cat food, and the next thing you know, a load of people were looking down at you. To make matters worse, you urinated yourself in the process, and bit your tongue. Apparently you had a fit where you jerked your arm around for about 2 minutes. Luckily a friendly junior doctor was walking by and realised what was happening and made sure you were kept safe until an ambulance came.\n",
      "Since then you have had one further fit, which was a similar nature. Indeed, all of your seizures tend to be dramatic, you never have those ‘absence’ seizures where you just stare into space. No, when you stare into space, it’s just because you’re bored!\n",

For that reason, you’ve stopped going out as much, which you do recognise is a shame.\n",

      "HPC: You first started feeling unwell two days ago, when you really didn’t feel yourself. Since then, things have gotten worse as you have had hold and cold episodes, and really bad stomach pain. You threw up once or twice, but this was mostly due to not being able to keep your food down.\n",
      "The pain is worst on your right hand side. It started down in your lower abdomen but has since moved to your right side and your back. It moves down to your right groin occasionally. It’s sore to touch at the moment. Paracetamol takes the edge off it a little, but not enough to make it bearable. Nothing in particular seems to make it worse. It is pretty constant.\n",
      "The temperatures have come and gone in episodes. It was at its highest when you went to the GP. You last opened your bowels 2 days ago, but this is normal for you, and you haven’t been eating anyway. Your appetite has been awful this week. You have had 2 episodes of vomiting but it was just food that came up. You haven’t had any swallowing problems and you haven’t had a cough.\n",
      "You have been going to the toilet to pass water a lot more than usual in the past week. You have been drinking a lot more energy drinks when trying to revise, and put this down to that. You haven’t had any pain in passing water, but you did think it looked quite dark when you saw it last. There was no blood in it though. Your skin looks the same and you don’t have any itch.\n",
      "ICE: You have been staying up long nights to do assignments and revise for your exams, so felt originally that you were just run down. However, your GP thinking this is appendicitis has scared you to no end, and really want a quick test to be able to tell if this is appendicitis. Your friend had his appendix out last year and that left him with a horrible scar: this is something you really want to avoid as you are supposed to be going on holiday after your exams!\n",
      "SH: You binge drink on occasional nights out, but these have dried up recently when entering the exam season, so you haven’t drunk alcohol in a while now. A typical night out might include half a bottle of vodka. You haven’t been anywhere abroad recently. You live in university halls.\n",

      "Perry Arrest is a 68 year old man who has presented to GP complaining of fatigue and left leg pain. This is a problem he has been having for 2 months and the pain has become so severe that he has quit his bi-weekly jogging club. He has been otherwise healthy in life, other than a series of chest infections over Christmas. He would to know what is causing his pain.\n",
      "Please take a history from Perry and undertake the most relevant examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are Perry Arrest, a 68 year old man who loves to keep fit. You used to be a long distance runner in the good old days, and are proud that you have continued running for so long.  However, for the last few months you haven’t been able to run as much as before, due to pain in your leg.\n",
      "HPC:\n",
      "The pain has come on gradually, and is getting worse and worse. It started two months ago, and is around your left hip. It sometimes moves to your left thigh. It’s worse when you exercise, which has really annoyed you, as you’ve had to stop going to the running club you lead. This is very disappointing, as you had just taken on a lot of new young runners, and feel like you are letting the team down. There’s nothing that makes the pain better, apart from stopping exercising. You also sometimes get the pain in your ribs, which is really unusual.\n",
      "You generally feel a lot more rubbish, too. Running would always give you a ‘get up and go’ motivation, but now you feel flat and tired all the time. You sleep for 9 hours a night and don’t feel very refreshed. You even have naps… you always said naps are for losers!\n",
      "The only other odd thing you have noticed is that you have some pain when you go to pass water. Your urine looks a little dark too. You think it might be because you’re not drinking enough water.\n",
      "You don’t have a cough, but you do have some shortness of breath. This comes on when you are running, so you haven’t noticed it all that much recently.\n",
      "You did have some shortness of breath before Christmas, when you had to go into hospital for chest infections. They were a bit unpleasant, and you coughed up some blood at one point. It was frustrating: as soon as you were able to shake off one infection, another one came along. However you have managed to win that battle a few months ago, so things are looking up!\n",
      "ICE: \n",
      "You thought that you might have pulled a muscle in your leg when this all started, but this has gone on for a while without getting better, so you’re not sure anymore. The last time you went to the GP about this, he asked you if you were depressed. You told him that the very idea was nonsense! Your mood has been fine, aside from being cranky that you can’t run. You’d like to find a diagnosis for all of this and a quick and simple treatment, ideally, so you can get back to your routine. No time to be wasted!\n",
      "PMH: \n",
      "You have broken your wrist in the past, and your right knee isn’t quite what it used to be: you think it might be a touch of arthritis. Otherwise, you’ve always been quite well, apart from the chest infections over Christmas. You don’t take any over the counter medications and don’t have any allergies.\n",
      "SH:\n",
      "You live with your wife, Paula. She has never been interested in running, despite your best efforts! She is quite worried about you, however, and has made you come along today.

A good systems inquiry should identify most of the salient points in this history, and addressing the ideas, concerns and expectations of the patient should make an ideal history. A musculoskeletal exam would be appropriate, or a respiratory examination could also be acceptable, depending on the student’s diagnosis.\n",
      "The student’s differential diagnosis should sound something like:\n",
      "My differential diagnosis would include a haematological cause, more specifically multiple myeloma. This is because this patient has presented with fatigue, bone pain and urinary symptoms which could indicate renal failure. However, it would be important to rule out other forms of malignancy, especially lung cancer. This could have spread to this patient’s bones, leading to bone pain. This is particularly relevant given the patient’s family history of lung cancer. Other diagnoses to consider would be renal cell carcinoma or SLE.\n",

      "You are Ira, a 60 year old retired school teacher, who has been experiencing pains in both legs for the past four months.\n",
      "HPC – it happens in both calves, when walking around. When it started about four months it tended to come on after about a quarter a mile, but in the last month it has been for much shorter distances (around 100 yards). Once it comes on, it will subside if you sit down or rest them for two or three minutes.\n",

      "ICE – you live alone, and so if this leg pain stops you from getting about, you’ll have no way of going shopping, seeing a couple of local friends or making your weekly visit your poetry recital class. Your friends are also “getting on” and so you feel you can’t rely on them for help getting about, and have no close family nearby. One of your friends said she was given a night tablet for leg cramps and you wonder if this is what is also needed for you, plus some tablets for the pain.\n",
      "PMH - you have had three heart attacks in the past five years, and had stents put in after the last one last year. Since the first heart attack you were started on aspirin, but don’t always take it. You take tablets for your diabetes and high blood pressure. You should also take a statin at night for your cholesterol but often forget.\n",

      "The student should summarise and conclude this patient is most likely has peripheral vascular disease, and that acute limb ischaemia would be the biggest concern for this patient due to the recent progression of symptoms (+/- examination findings)\n",

      "You are 28 weeks pregnant and planned this pregnancy with your husband, who is a lawyer. You had no difficulties conceiving and had only stopped using the combined oral contraceptive three months ago. You have a bad memory for dates and are therefore unsure about your estimated delivery date, but you are 28 weeks pregnant according to the scans. You are not sure about your last menstrual period. Your immunisations are up to date and have been taking folic acid since coming off “the pill”.\n",
      "Antenatal care\n",
      "You are under consultant care “because of your weight”. At your last appointment, you were told that your BMI is 35, which you were horrified about – you know it is far too much.

You wish your previous pregnancies had been this smooth!\n",
      "Past obstetric history\n",
      "This is your third pregnancy. You unfortunately lost your first child during labour after “he got stuck” fifteen years ago. You were rushed to theatre for an emergency caesarean and you do not remember much about that pregnancy. It was a difficult time and you would prefer not to discuss the details surrounding that today.\n",
      "Eight years ago, during your second pregnancy, you gave birth to a girl called Blessing. She is currently in preschool and excels amongst her peers. Blessing weighed 4.3 kg when she was born via emergency caesarean after “Blessing’s heart rate starting to slow down.” You took a long time to recover from the second caesarean section and the wound got infected a few days later.

You weren’t paying attention at first, but you think it might have been towards the end of your urinating. \n",
      "It isn’t this colour every time you go, but it’s been happening more and more frequently over the past few weeks. There isn’t any pain associated with it but you have been going to the bathroom more often. When you pass urine, sometimes you feel that you have a bit more to get rid of, but can’t quite manage it.\n",

      "In terms of other problems, you haven’t noticed anything major. You have had one or two aches and pains, but you’ve tried to go more walking recently as it’s nesting season for your favourite bird – the puffin. There are some puffins on the little islands near your home at the coast, and you really enjoy going walking to see them. Anything that made you unwell would really distract you from that, and you couldn’t have that!\n",

You think you might have been a bit depressed after he died, however you have come to terms with things since. \n",

      "You’ve had a few water infections in the past, so you reckon that this might be another one, though the blood in disturbing you. Could it be a really bad water infection?

      "“My differential diagnosis would consist of a urological cause: more specifically bladder cancer. This is because of the presentation of painless frank haematuria, on a background of cigarette smoking and history of working with dyes.
